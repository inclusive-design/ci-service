        # Several things going on here:
        #
        # - The pip provided by CentOS 7 via python-virtualenv has trouble
        # installing things (see
        # https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/937). We need an upgraded
        # pip *before* we can install the other requirements, so we do that as
        # its own step. We nudge it up from the CentOS 7 default to be
        # minimally opinionated about which version gets installed.
        #
        # - /tmp on Jenkins node h-0005.tor1.inclusivedesign.ca is mounted
        # noexec, which prevents pycyrpto (in requirements.txt) from running
        # autoconf (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/1294670). So
        # we make a local tmpdir and use it when installing from
        # requirements.txt.
        #
        # - This is a dubious amount of work to do in a build one-liner. I
        # considered moving to Tox but decided to stop here. If you are
        # thinking of adding more steps here, please consider instead moving to
        # Tox (or a Makefile or a shell script or something).
        #
        # ansible-lint is also upgraded due to https://github.com/willthames/ansible-lint/issues/278
